# newspaper

newspaper is a system to control my news ingestion. Starting with the 2016 US election cycle, I developed a bad habit of subscribing to a massive number of feeds that all a) told me the same stories, and b) exposed me to at least one OpEd per story per feed, all variations on the same. I began to suffer from a content ingestion bottleneck and a dearth of microdistractions. 

Solving this problem will require some self control, but I can minimze self control required by limiting my subscriptions to those that provide unique (and original source) content, and scheduling delivery. The approach will be similar to feedbook, which has been discontinued.
